# Web-Design-Challenge

Georgia Tech Data Analytics BootCamp - March 2023

Homework Module 11 - Web Design Challenge
By Priscila Menezes Briggs

Challenge history
For this challenge I created a visualization dashboard website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap that includes a dashboard showing off an analysis previously done. The analysis consisted of 4 plots of weather data showing comparisons regarding latitude vs. temperature, cloudiness, humidity and wind speed. 

The website was created inspired by the example given by this homework directions using an approach to reproduce it as much as possible.

The webpage consists of the following 7 individual pages:
 * An index (landing) page, which contains an explanation of the project and gives access to a visualizations sidebar containing preview images of each plot with links to them, and the navigation menu with a dropdown menu.
 * A comparison page, showing all 4 plots at once, so we can easily visually compare them. Bootstrap grid was used in this case.
 * A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
 * 4 visualization pages, each one showing a different plot with a descriptive title, and an explanation about the plot and its significance.

All pages can be visited through any of the pages by clicking on the corresponding plot or option from the navbar.

All pages are responsive regarding different sizes of screen.

Ultimately, the website was deployed to GitHub. 

In addition to the HTML and CSS files that contain each page's coding and the resource files (images and csv file with dataset), there is a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for transforming the dataframe into HTML data. 

The script for this challenge is found in the GitHub's repository on:
